# My Design to HTML Collection 🎨➡️💻🐍 

This repository showcases my personal journey and collection of projects where I've converted design mockups (Figma, PSD, etc.) into functional HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript and SCSS. It's a place to track my progress, share my code, and hopefully inspire others learning front-end development.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

*   **HTML:** The foundation of all web pages.
*   **CSS:** For styling and layout.
*   **SCSS:** CSS preprocessor.
*   **JavaScript (sometimes):** For interactive elements and dynamic functionality.
*   **Figma/PSD/PNG (source designs):** The design tools used to create the original mockups.
*   **Responsive Design Principles:** Ensuring compatibility across different devices.

## How to use this repository 🚀

1.  **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/NGH14/design-into-code.git` or `git@github.com:NGH14/design-into-code.git`
2.  **Navigate to the project folder:** `cd <PROJECT_FOLDER>` (change the PROJECT_FOLDER with specific folder name)
3.  **Open the `index.html` file in your browser:** This will display the converted HTML page.
