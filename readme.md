# My Design to HTML Collection üé®‚û°Ô∏èüíª

This repository showcases my personal journey and collection of projects where I've converted design mockups (Figma, PSD, etc.) into functional HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript and SCSS. It's a place to track my progress, share my code, and hopefully inspire others learning front-end development.

## What you'll find here ‚ú®

*   **Diverse Projects:** A variety of projects ranging from simple landing pages to more "complex web applications" (hope so).
*   **Clean and Organized Code:** I strive to write well-structured and maintainable code, making it easy to understand and learn from.
*   **Real-world Examples:** Practical examples of how to implement different design patterns and layouts.
*   **Progress Tracking:** This repo acts as a portfolio of my front-end development skills.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

*   **HTML:** The foundation of all web pages.
*   **CSS:** For styling and layout.
*   **SCSS:** CSS preprocessor.
*   **JavaScript (sometimes):** For interactive elements and dynamic functionality.
*   **Figma/PSD/PNG (source designs):** The design tools used to create the original mockups.
*   **Responsive Design Principles:** Ensuring compatibility across different devices.

## How to use this repository üöÄ

1.  **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/NGH14/design-into-code.git` or `git@github.com:NGH14/design-into-code.git`
2.  **Navigate to the project folder:** `cd <PROJECT_FOLDER>` (change the PROJECT_FOLDER with specific folder name)
3.  **Open the `index.html` file in your browser:** This will display the converted HTML page.

## Contributing ü§ù

While this repository primarily showcases my personal work, constructive feedback and suggestions are always welcome! If you have any ideas for improvement or find any issues, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Project Structure üìÇ

Each project resides in its own folder. Inside each project folder, you'll typically find:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file.
*   `style.css`: The CSS stylesheet.
*   `script.js` _(if applicable)_: The JavaScript file.
*   `assets/` _(if applicable)_: A folder containing images, fonts, and other assets.
*   `design/` _(if applicable)_: A folder containing the original design files (Figma links, screenshots, etc.)
